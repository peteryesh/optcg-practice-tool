 * says the signal names no card*, and that is what lets a subject-less signal activate
 * an effect at all.
 *
 * `subject` is MANDATORY on the carrying arm, deliberately. An optional filter makes a
 * forgotten one silent, and the effect it breaks is On-Play — "when this is played"
 * would quietly become "when ANYONE plays a character".
 *
 * BATTLE IS NOT MODELLED HERE, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. Combat signals name cards in
 * several distinct roles (attacker vs defender), which neither arm expresses, so they
 * fall into the subject-less arm and `selectSubjects` throws for them. That throw is a
 * PERMANENT ASSERTION, not a migration TODO: "when attacking" and "on opponent's
 * attack" are PHASE-KEYED — they watch a battle phase through `phase` and read
 * `state.currentBattle` at resolution. Do NOT "fix" the throw by pushing combat into
 * the flat-subjects arm. If a card ever genuinely needs role-filtered subjects it gets
 * its own arm naming which role it filters, over named `CardSnapshot` fields on the
 * signal — never a role tag added to `subjects`.

/**
 * A card as it was at a single instant — the unit signals carry as their subjects,
 * and the universal input to `evalCardFilter`.
 *
 * Live evaluation is "a snapshot taken now"; last-known information is "a snapshot
 * taken then". Same type either way — the only difference is when `captureSnapshot`
 * ran. Keeping it one type is what stops `CardFilter` forking into live and frozen
 * paths across its three users (activation subjects, StatusEffectDef.affects,
 * actionGen gating).
 *
 * Holds identity plus everything MUTABLE. Printed identity — name, colors, types,
 * attributes — is recovered from `cardId` instead, because `state.definitions` is
 * immutable for the life of the game: a lookup later returns exactly what a copy now
 * would have. Capture exists for the fields that CHANGE, so copying the ones that
 * cannot is pure weight on `gameLog`.

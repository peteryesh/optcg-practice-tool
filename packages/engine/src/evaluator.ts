 * The candidate is a `CardSnapshot` rather than an id, and that is the point: this
 * function cannot tell whether it is reading the live board or a subject captured
 * before a mutation, so activation, targeting and `StatusEffectDef.affects` all share
 * one implementation instead of forking into live and frozen paths.
 *
 * Callers holding an id evaluate "as of now" by calling `captureSnapshot` first.
 *
 * `state` is still needed for the printed fields, which the snapshot deliberately
 * does not copy — see `CardSnapshot`.
